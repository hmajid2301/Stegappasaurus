## Full description: 

<b>Introduction</b>

Stegappasaurus is a free mobile application fully open source, built using React Native. This application uses steganography algorithms to hide your (text) data within images.
This project was originally created as third year project for University. However this version is a complete rewrite of the application.

Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video.
The word Steganography combines the Greek words  steganos  (στεγανός), meaning "covered, concealed, or protected", and  graphein (γράφειν) meaning "writing".

You use the app to select an image, enter your message and wait for it to encode your image. After the image has been encoded you can then share it with others. They can then use the app to decode the image and retrieve the original encoded message. You can share images using any platform you like, such as Whatsapp, Facebook, Email etc.
The encoded images look identical to normal images to the naked eye you cannot tell the difference between them.

<b>Features</b>

★ ENCODING: Encode images and decode images with text.

★ SELECT IMAGES: Choose images from your photo album, from thecatapi or take a photo with your camera.

★ UTF-8: Encode any unicode characters, including emojis in to your image.

★ ALGORITHMS: Encode data using LSB.

★ NO ADS: Enjoy the app without any apps, all completely free.

★ SHARE: Share images directly to the application to start decoding.


<b>Note:</b> The LSB algorithm is not very resistant to compression, so if you compress the image a lot you could lose your encoded message. Certain platforms like Whatsapp and Facebook heavily compress images sent via their apps. So note the image may not be decoded correctly.
