Stegappasaurus is an open-source free mobile application, built using React Native. This application uses steganography algorithms to hide data within images.
The project was originally conceptualised as a third-year project for university. It has since then been completely rewritten from scratch. It was originally written using Ionic/Apache Cordova.

Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video. The word Steganography combines the Greek words steganos (στεγανός), meaning "covered, concealed, or protected", and graphein (γράφειν) meaning "writing".

The app is very simple to use simply: select an image, enter your message and wait for it to encode your message within the image. After the image has been encoded you can then share this image with other people. They can then use this app to decode the image and retrieve the original message.
