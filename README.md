# Introduction

This is a mobile app made with React Native and Expo. The app allows user to encode and decode messages within images using
Steganography. This is a rewrite of my dissertation project, written in my third year of university.

## Getting Started

### a) With Docker (:whale:)

Assuming the following are installed;

    * Android Simulator (Genymotion)
    * Docker/Docker Compose

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hmajid2301/Stegappasaurus.git
cd Stegappasaurus
touch .env
docker-compose up --build -d
```

### b) Without Docker (:no_entry: :whale:)

Assuming the following are installed;

    * Android Simulator (Genymotion)
    * Yarn

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hmajid2301/Stegappasaurus.git
cd Stegappasaurus
touch .env
yarn
npm android
```

### Example `.env` file

`.env` file should have the following variables defined

```bash
EXPO_USERNAME="username"
EXPO_PASSWORD="password"
ADB_IP="device_ip"
```

## Other

### Open Genymotion Emulator from CLI

To open the android emulator from cli, you can use the following command.
