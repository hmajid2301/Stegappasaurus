    title: 'What is steganography?',
    content: 'Steganography is the art/science of hiding data in plain sight. In the context of this app, it allows ' +
      'you to hide messages (text) within images. You do this by encoding the image with the text data. You can then share the image ' +
      'with other people and they can decode the image (retrieve the original message) using this app.',
  },
  {
    title: 'So is it the same as encryption?',
    content: 'Not quite, encryption involves obscuring information whereas steganography is concerned with hiding it. ' +
      'With encryption if you have the encrypted message you cannot retrieve the original message. \n\n' +

      'Whereas with steganography if you know where to look you can retrieve the original message, it is not obscured in any way. ' +
      'However, with encryption it is obvious you are trying to hide something but with steganography you can hide your message inside ' +
      'of an "innocent" looking image, with a third party without anyone noticing.\n\n' +

      'You can combine the two "techniques", encrypt your data before encoding it into an image, then simply decrypt the' +
      'message after decoding it from the image, ' +
      'for added security. This involves a shared secret "password" between you and the person you are sending the image to.',
  },
  {
    title: 'How does this app work?',
    content: 'This app uses different steganography algorithms to encode the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) pixel values with the text ' +
      'data in such a way that the original data can be retrieved at a later date.\n\n' +

      'After the image has been encoded you can save the image, then you can share this image and you use this app ' +
      'to decode and get the originally encoded message.\n\n' +

      'In general each algorithm will encode the size of the message, this is so that when decoding the image we know when to stop. ' +
      'It will then encode a separator (Â£ in ASCII), this is so that again when we decode we know from this point to decode n characters. ' +
      'Each character in the message usually uses 8 bits in the images, this is because we encode it as a the ASCII representation of the letter or symbol.',
  },
  {
    title: 'What Algorithms can you use?',
    content: 'You can use the following algorithms to encode/decode images: \n\n' +
              'Bitmap Least Significant Bit (LSB) \n' +
              'Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) Least Significant Bit (LSB) \n',
  },
  {
    title: 'How much data can I encode with LSB?',
    content: 'It all depends on the image resolution, the bigger the image the more data you can encode. ' +
      'To find out if your message will fit in the image you should solve Equation 1 shown below where,' +
      '\n\n h = Image Height (in Pixels), \n w = Image Width (in pixels) and \n m is the number of characters in your message\n\n' +

      'To find the maximum number of characters we can encode we must use the same equation above except we = 0 not > 0 and we will solve for "m". ' +
      'Let\'s say our image is 100 x 100, then we have 100 * 100 * 3 = 30,000 - 8 (for separator) = 29,992. So 29,992 = ceil(log2(m)) - 8m = 3747. ' +
      'So using the LSB algorithm we can encode a message with 3747 characters.\n\n' +
      'Note: With LSB we only can encode one bit per byte of data, so that we don\'t completely change the colour of that pixel.' +
      'Equation 1: 3(h * w) - ceil(log2(m)) - 8m -8 > 0',
  },
  {
    title: 'Can you show me an example?',
    content: 'We will use an image 100 x 100 = 10,000 pixels. So 10,000 * 3 * 8 = 30,000 bits we can encode.' +
      'Let\'s say we want to encode "Hello World!", it\'s of length 12 so ceil(log2(12)) = 4 bits for the length of the message. ' +
      'So  4 + 8 = 12 bits required so far. Each character we encode will take 8 bits and we have 12 characters ' +
      '(including blank space) 12 * 8 = 96 bits for the message, so in total 96 + 12 = 108 bits ' +
      'would be required out of 30,000, to encode the message "Hello World!".',
  },
  {
    title: 'Why can we only use one bit out of every byte?',
    content: 'If we used the entire byte, remember per pixel we get 3 bytes (one for each RGB item), we would drastically ' +
