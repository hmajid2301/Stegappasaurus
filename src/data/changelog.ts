# Changelog

## [1.0.2] - 2020-02-23
Updated play store listing with new screenshots and featured graphic.
Also fixed small bugs when trying to share app and the action not being
logged correctly.

## [1.0.1] - 2020-02-01
Better error monitoring so that issues effecting user's of the app can be better tracked
and therefore resolved. It seems issues with encoding/decoding aren't currently being tracked correctly.
Can see issues in the app analytics but cannot see what is causing the errors.

## [1.0.0] - 2020-01-31
Initial Release.`;
