      "Steganography is the art/science of hiding data in plain sight. In the context of this app, it allows " +
      "you to hide messages (text) within images. You do this by encoding the image with the text data. You can then share the image " +
      "with other people and they can decode the image (retrieve the original message) using this app.",

      "Not quite, encryption involves obscuring information whereas steganography is concerned with hiding it. " +
      "With encryption if you have the encrypted message you cannot retrieve the original message. \n\n" +
      "Whereas with steganography if you know where to look you can retrieve the original message, it is not obscured in any way. " +
      "However, with encryption it is obvious you are trying to hide something but with steganography you can hide your message inside " +
      'of an "innocent" looking image, with a third party without anyone noticing.\n\n' +
      'You can combine the two "techniques", encrypt your data before encoding it into an image, then simply decrypt the' +
      "message after decoding it from the image, " +
      'for added security. This involves a shared secret "password" between you and the person you are sending the image to.',

      "This app uses different steganography algorithms to encode the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) pixel values with the text " +

      "After the image has been encoded you can save the image, then you can share this image and you use this app " +
      "to decode and get the originally encoded message.\n\n" +
      "In general each algorithm will encode the size of the message, this is so that when decoding the image we know when to stop. " +
      "It will then encode a separator (Â£ in ASCII), this is so that again when we decode we know from this point to decode n characters. " +
      "Each character in the message usually uses 8 bits in the images, this is because we encode it as a the ASCII representation of the letter or symbol.",

      'To find the maximum number of characters we can encode we must use the same equation above except we = 0 not > 0 and we will solve for "m". ' +
      "Let's say our image is 100 x 100, then we have 100 * 100 * 3 = 30,000 - 8 (for separator) = 29,992. So 29,992 = ceil(log2(m)) - 8m = 3747. " +
      "So using the LSB algorithm we can encode a message with 3747 characters.\n\n" +
