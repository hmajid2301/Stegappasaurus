# Contributing

Three main ways to contribute to this project are;

- **Adding a new feature:** Adding a new feature to the project, such as allow encoding of audio files alongside images
- **Improving a feature:** Extend/improve an existing feature, such as a small UI change
- **Fix an issue:** We have a list of [issues](https://gitlab.com/hmajid2301/stegappasaurus/issues), or you can fix your own issue.

**Note**: Please do the following before raising an MR

- Raise an issue before creating an MR
- Name of the branch after the issue number you are fixing i.e. feature/#105
- Merge from the feature branch to the master branch (never to the `production` branch)

**Optional**: For better issue tracking if you log how long the issue took you too work on, [more information here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/time_tracking.html).
This is so we can reconcile how long an issue took to complete vs what was expected.

## Setup Dev Environment

To set up this project on your own development machine, do the following.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hmajid2301/stegappasaurus.git
cd stegappasaurus
touch .env
yarn install
adb connect <device_ip>
yarn run start
# Then in another terminal
yarn run android
```

## Example `.env` file

The `.env` file should have the following variables defined (you can look at `util/generateDotEnv.sh` for an example template file). Though if you're only trying to test
this app locally the `.env` file is optional the app will still function without
them.

```bash
# BUGSNAG API KEY, used for error tracking
BUGSNAG_API_KEY=xxxxx
# API Key for the `thecatapi`
CAT_API_KEY=xxx
```

## Git Workflow

We use the [squash and rebase](https://blog.carbonfive.com/2017/08/28/always-squash-and-rebase-your-git-commits/), with [Gitlab workflow](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee//topics/gitlab_flow.html#production-branch-with-gitlab-flow).

Essentially how it works is we have a master branch where features are merged onto.
When all the issues in the milestone have been completed, we then merge the `master`
branch into `production`. The `production` branch is then tagged for release (i.e. `release/1.0.1`).

We use [GitMoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/), in our git titles.
This makes it easier at a glance to see what commit is related to.

## Release Management

Before a new version of the app is released to production (after having merged `master` into `production`). We will first tag it as a `dev` release. This will release the app
in the internal track (for my personal testing). Then once I am happy with this we can then
tag it as a `test` release, which promotes the app from the internal track to the beta track.
Finally once this round of testing is complete (roughly two weeks). It will be tagged with `release` and automatically published to the production track and everyone can use the app.

## Project

### Project Structure

Most of the code resides within the `src` folder;

- actions: Are things that the app can do, such as auto toggle the dark theme
- assets: Include things like fonts and images
- components: Are React components that can be shared between multiple views
- constants: Constants use throughout the app, such as colours
- data: Is content used within components such as the about us list
- providers: The React contexts
- views: All the different "pages" the user can see/navigate too in the application

### Views

There are two main sets of views, the encoding/decoding pages and the settings pages.

#### View Structure

Home
The views are structured as follows (using React Navigation):

`App.tsx`: Contains all the introduction logic such as the intro slides, showing the user
the statistics usage alert etc.

`MainApp.tsx`: Creates the tab navigator for encoding/decoding to show to the user.

`Encoding.tsx`: (Or `Decoding.tsx`) are stack navigators which include all the pages for
encoding such as `Main`, `Message` and `Progress` stack navigators.

#### Settings

The settings page has all the settings the user can set in the app, such as dark/light theme.
It also includes other pieces of information such as the license, changelog, privacy policy and more.

<div
  style="
    text-align: center;
">
  <iframe
    width="650"
    height="400"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7gpZvp4ElrU"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowfullscreen
  />
</div>

#### Encoding

##### Main

The main page (also acts as the home page for the app) is where the user chooses what image to encode.
They can either;

- Take a photo with their camera
- Select a photo from their camera roll
- Use a random cat photo from the internet
- Select an image from their gallery shown as a flat list (3 per row)

<div
  style="
    text-align: center;
">
  <iframe
    width="650"
    height="400"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EfTwwnhVVZg"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowfullscreen
  />
</div>

##### Message

This is where the user enters the message they want to be encoded in their (selected image).

<div
  style="
    text-align: center;
">
  <iframe
    width="650"
    height="400"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8DB7tSx0-FA"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowfullscreen
  />
</div>

##### Progress

This is where the image is encoded using the steganography algorithm. The progress is updated through a progress
circle, which increments with every bit encoded. The new encoded image is then saved to the user's gallery.
The user can then share the image with others.

<div
  style="
    text-align: center;
">
  <iframe
    width="650"
    height="400"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ndYsJhvNSYo"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

#### Decoding

<div
  style="
    text-align: center;
">
  <iframe
    width="650"
    height="400"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QUAyBA2folU"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

##### Main

The main page is where the user chooses which image to decode.
They can either;

- Select a photo from their camera roll
- Select an image from their gallery shown as a flat list (3 per row)

##### Progress

This is where the image is decoded using the steganography algorithm. The progress is updated through a progress
circle, which increments with every bit decoded.

##### Message

This is where the user is shown the decoded message on a (non-editable) text input.

## Style Guide

We use a combination of prettier and tslint to do the code formatting and code linting for us.
Make sure the `yarn run code-formatter-check` and `yarn run lint` both pass before submitting an MR.

### imports

Leave a single blank line between first/third party and our imports.

```typescript
import * as React from 'react';
import {View} from 'react-native';
import {NavigationScreenProp} from 'react-navigation';

import ImageMessage from '~/components/ImageMessage';
import Snackbar from '~/components/Snackbar';
```

### Module Resolver

We are using the babel module resolver (typescript aliases and jest module mapper) so that the `~` (tilde) maps to src.
So avoid long relative paths prefer to use `~` instead.

```typescript
// wrong
import ImageMessage from '../../../../components/ImageMessage';

// right
import ImageMessage from '~/components/ImageMessage';
```

### Arrow Functions

If you can use normal functions only define arrow functions if the function needs to be bound.

```tsx
public render() {
  return (
    <View>
      <FlatList
        data={this.padData(this.state.photos)}
        keyExtractor={(item, index) => item.uri + index}
        numColumns={3}
        onEndReached={this.morePhotosFromCameraRoll}
        onRefresh={this.handleRefresh}
        renderItem={this.renderPhotosFromCameraRoll}
        refreshing={this.state.refreshing}
      />
    </View>
  );
}

public async componentDidMount() {
  setTimeout(async () => {
    await this.getPhotosFromCameraRoll();
  }, 1000);
}

// ...

private handleRefresh = async () => {
  this.setState({ refreshing: true });
  await this.getPhotosFromCameraRoll();
};
```

### Function Ordering

Prefer to keep the render function as the first function and everything after it.

```tsx
// wrong
public async componentdidmount() {
  settimeout(async () => {
    await this.getphotosfromcameraroll();
  }, 1000);
}

public render() {
  return (
  );
}
```

```tsx
// right
public render() {
  return (
  );
}

public async componentdidmount() {
  settimeout(async () => {
    await this.getphotosfromcameraroll();
  }, 1000);
}
```

## Code Coverage

If you do make a change make sure to update the unit tests they must always pass,
you must also keep the code coverage higher or the same it cannot be lower as a result
of your change. You can run `yarn run coverage` so see the coverage when the table is
generated look at the `% Stmts` and `All files` number.
